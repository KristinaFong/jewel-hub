Hi! Thanks for stopping by. 
This was a project that I completed at Juno College. I was able to take the provided design and implement HTML and CSS to bring it to life. 

To view the project, open the 'index.html' file in your browser (ie. Firefox). Adjust the browser width to explore how I implemented responsiveness into my design. 
All of the code for both the 'index.html' and the 'styles.css' was produced by me. 
If you have any feedback at all please reach out. 

Thanks!
